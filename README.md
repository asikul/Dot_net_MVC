MVC is a framework for building web applications using a MVC (Model View Controller) design

Entity Framework (EF) is an object-relational mapper that enables .NET developers to work with relational data using domain-specific objects. It eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write.


C# is a strong Object Oriented programming language that is mostly built on the .NET framework. C# is the airplane and .NET is the 
runway ;) C# is a language, .NET is an application framework. The .NET libraries can run on the CLR and thus any language which can 
run on the CLR can also use the .NET libraries.
